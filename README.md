# tori-runtime-governance
TORI: A governed, AI-native runtime framework for predictable behavior, bounded failure, auditability, and inference cost control.
> TORI is a compositional operating framework, not a single prompt or technique.
> Its value derives from the integration and sequencing of governance, routing,
> policy enforcement, auditability, and rollback controls.
>
> This repository is published for review by senior AI research, safety,
> infrastructure, and governance leadership.
