TORI: A governed, AI-native runtime framework for predictable behavior, bounded failure, auditability, and inference cost control.
> TORI is a compositional operating framework, not a single prompt or technique.

What this repository is (and is not)

This repository is evidence of how I reason about governance, risk, and failure under uncertainty, not a finished or deployable system.

TORI reflects one iteration of an operating model; its value is in the decisions, constraints, and tradeoffs, not the artifact itself.

Any real deployment would require context-specific evolution, human ownership, and organizational integration, which this repository does not attempt to provide.

The purpose of publishing is to make judgment and assumptions inspectable, not to propose direct adoption.
